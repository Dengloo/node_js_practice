Port = process.env.PORT || 3500

Port should create a browser instance that returns information about the response

Port listens to http stuff from port 3500
when you dns to it, you are sending a get request and a url

Port.method
Port.path
Port.req
Port.res

if you are going to use information obtained from the browser you need to use port

const server = http.createServer((req,res) => {

const server = http.createServer((Port.req,

iPort.res) => {

let addition (x,y) {
	a + b;
}

addition(4,3)
